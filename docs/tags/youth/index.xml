      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-issue-of-nihilism&#34;&gt;The Issue of Nihilism&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems quite apparent today that there is a growing divide between the generations within the church. And it comes down to this, those that are young adults today were raised within a world that has metaphysically and physically reached the bottom of a cultural descent into nihilism. There is no purpose, it’s not ‘cool’ to try. Aspiration is treated as naive, even embarrassing. There’s no purpose to life, so seeking easy dopamine and rotting is all that’s left.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
