      <description>&lt;p&gt;What ever happened to the world?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s all take, take, take&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mutter worry and groan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What ever happened to life?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where hope is more than a figment known,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where joy is real,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where hope heals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Peace on earth,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And goodwill to men&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where your story begins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wandering through the winding streets of shadowed stone,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world is fear and fight,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A ceaseless march into the night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope despairing,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Problem with Catholic Young Adult Groups</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-issue-of-nihilism&#34;&gt;The Issue of Nihilism&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems quite apparent today that there is a growing divide between the generations within the church. And it comes down to this, those that are young adults today were raised within a world that has metaphysically and physically reached the bottom of a cultural descent into nihilism. There is no purpose, it’s not ‘cool’ to try. Aspiration is treated as naive, even embarrassing. There’s no purpose to life, so seeking easy dopamine and rotting is all that’s left.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Steelmanning Modernist Music &amp; A Rebuttal</title>
      <link>https://frassati.blonocatholic.com/blog/2026/01/19/steelmanning-modern-music/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the previous article on sacred music, it seems prudent to look at how it applies to the state of the current perspectives of liturgical changes. In intellectual discourse, steelmanning means presenting the strongest possible version of an opponent’s argument before critiquing it. Unlike strawmanning, which attacks a weak caricature, steelmanning engages with the best evidence and reasoning available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, we’ll steelman the case for including nontraditional music, guitar-led hymns, and contemporary worship songs in the Mass. Proponents argue these align with Vatican II’s vision for a vibrant, participatory liturgy, citing Church documents and papal statements. We will analyze whether current practices are in line with these teachings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Unnecessary End of the Male Life Cycle</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-comfort-crisis&#34;&gt;The Comfort Crisis&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a creeping complacency in our modern age—a desire to be comfortable, non-confrontational, and liked. This comfort masquerades as virtue, particularly in how we understand manhood. The feminization of the culture has also overtaken traditional circles, erasing the masculine excellence that they purport to be the heralds of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many conservatives, like Charlie Kirk and Tucker, now parrot a secularized version of Christian marriage, even if this is not their intention this is the effect. They state the most impactful thing a man can do is “get married and have children,” as if procreation alone were the ultimate end of man’s purpose, rather than a means ordered toward something higher. This view has reduced marriage to a consumerist product: a way to feel complete, settle down, to fulfill a personal dream. But in truth, marriage is a sacrament, a mission—a crucible of sanctification, not a retreat from the battle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Against Contraception in All Its Forms</title>
      <link>https://frassati.blonocatholic.com/blog/2025/03/31/against-all-contraception/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in a contraceptive culture, and the condoms are just a little snowflake on top of the life-hating iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-tale-of-grass&#34;&gt;The Tale of Grass&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I ran into a group reading Marc Barnes’ lovely piece on counterproductivity. Once upon a time, we cut the grass to feed it to cows - now, we cut it even more frequently with zero productivity. The peasants got hay in return for their workout - in return for our spent gasoline and fertilizer, we get hearing damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Arthur Penty and the Guild System</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;circling-an-idea&#34;&gt;Circling an Idea&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been several books that I’ve encountered in my life that really were moments not of revelation, but of cementation: all the random jostling thoughts in my head coalescing in another’s writings. Or perhaps, “permission to think” a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arthur Penty’s Restoration of Gild Systems is such a book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We say over and over again, “if you’re not paying, you’re the product, not the customer” in regards to social media. But Penty said it better and much harsher:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
