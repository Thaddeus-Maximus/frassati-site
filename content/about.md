We are a group of young men around the Bloomington-Normal, IL area who are empassioned about the teachings of the Church, in particular her social teachings as explained in encyclicals such as Rerum Novarum, Quadragessimo Anno, and Quanta Cura.

We also love the life an example of St. Pier Giorgio Frassati, who sought to live radically and make the whole of the world won over to Christ.

We meet weekly to study such texts and books. If this sounds like you, [contact us.](/contact)
