# The Comfort Crisis

There is a creeping complacency in our modern age—a desire to be comfortable, non-confrontational, and liked. This comfort masquerades as virtue, particularly in how we understand manhood. The feminization of the culture has also overtaken traditional circles, erasing the masculine excellence that they purport to be the heralds of.

Many conservatives, like Charlie Kirk and Tucker, now parrot a secularized version of Christian marriage, even if this is not their intention this is the effect. They state the most impactful thing a man can do is “get married and have children,” as if procreation alone were the ultimate end of man’s purpose, rather than a means ordered toward something higher. This view has reduced marriage to a consumerist product: a way to feel complete, settle down, to fulfill a personal dream. But in truth, marriage is a sacrament, a mission—a crucible of sanctification, not a retreat from the battle.

So many men get married or enter a relationship and they lose their drive to be an agent within the world. Neutered by domesticity, they have reached what for many is the end of the male life cycle. No longer do they ask what they may do for God and the world. Their energy is redirected entirely to the preferences of their wives or girlfriends, placing them in submission to female headship. This is not love, nor virtue—it is capitulation.

# The “Trad” Illusion

The “trad” aesthetic romanticizes domesticity and strips men of their mission and masculinity, and marriage of its sacramental nature. This is seen in the overemphasis of retreatism and the homesteading aesthetic, when used in search of a peaceful life—contrary to the masculine imposition of will for change in the world.

It is thinly veiled complacency proclaimed as heroism and virtue. Having children alone is not enough, it is neither an end in itself, nor even the highest form of self-sacrifice.

Some men are called to celibacy, which St. Paul praises as the highest sacrifice,

    “He who refrains from marriage will do even better.” —1 Corinthians 7:38

Celibacy is not a rejection of masculinity—it is its perfection in radical service of the Kingdom, a perfect imitation of Christ. To stay focused on their mission they will not marry. Those called are soldiers of Christ, freed from the binding attachments of the world, they are the most free to completely serve God. Their spiritual children surpass only having children of the flesh in eternal impact. To embrace celibacy for the Kingdom is to take the most intense fire of manhood and place it on the altar.

Yet marriage, too, is a path to holiness. The modern problem arises because the masculine role has been inverted. Men are told to obey their wives in the name of chivalry, to provide and protect—but without corresponding moral authority. Traditional language is twisted to moralize upon men, guilting them into a disordered compliance by misrepresenting what the Church teaches and depriving them of headship. This false liberty and unnatural equality of authority, which are to the detriment of the husband, is the cause of the dissolution of families and the downfall of society itself.

# Role of Headship

In these times of disorder and confusion, the following teachings are useful for those who are in the position to raise Catholic families: Pope Leo XIII reminded us in his Encyclical Arcanum (Feb. 10, 1880):

    "The husband is the chief of the family and the head of the wife. The woman...must be subject to her husband and obey him; not indeed, as a servant, but as a companion, so that her obedience shall be wanting in neither honor nor dignity. Since the husband represents Christ, and since the wife represents the Church, let there always be, both in him who commands and in her who obeys, a heaven-born love guiding both in their respective duties"

Later, in Casti Connubii (Dec. 31, 1930), Pope Pius XI proclaimed this order of the family as unchangeable and constituted by God:

    "...this subjection of wife to husband in its degree and manner may vary according to the different conditions of persons, place and time.... But the structure of the family and its fundamental law, established and confirmed by God, must always and everywhere be maintained intact."

The woman, once the heart of the home, is now taught to suspect her own nature. While St. John Paul II wrote,

    “The dignity of women is measured by the order of love, which is essentially the order of justice and charity.” —Mulieris Dignitatem

Today, asking women for the feminine virtues of patience, obedience, quietness, and gentleness of spirit is branded as oppressive–too much to ask for in the “modern” world. Wives will openly mock or critique their husbands. She seeks to receive praise for her “biblical femininity”, yet his faults are dissected in public. The man is held responsible for everything that goes wrong. If the marriage fails, it’s his fault. If his wife lacks virtue, he must have failed. If a husband expresses concern over his wife’s bitterness or irresponsibility he is advised, “You need to love her more like Christ loves the Church.” Rarely is the wife called to introspection or repentance in equal measure. This is not headship, it is emasculation with a trad costume.

Popular media has reinforced this dysfunction: the “true man” is one who lays down all selfhood to please a woman—his masculinity is defined entirely by her whims. Epitomized by the archetype of the Hallmark movie, the man’s arc is one of surrendering his ambition, principles, or even faith for the sake of “love”. In movies and television, husbands are often reduced to bumbling fools, while their wives are shown as the wise, capable leaders of the home.

He does whatever he can to obey his wife, and is obedient towards her, like a knight in shining armor. He would put a village to the sword for her, but this is not real. This sort of man places his masculinity as residing within his fixation on her, his obedience to her. Inside of this trad matrix where the man is the protector, provider, the knight in shining armor, what is the wife, she is absolved of all corresponding responsibility.

This dynamic turns marriage into a one-sided contract: the man bears all the burdens, yet commands no respect. The husband is expected to embody all virtues of the middle ages, but what of the woman? The trad matrix places all responsibility upon the man, while giving him no authority. This belittles the dignity of both man and woman, asking each to act outside of their nature only leading to harm.

Headship is not the imposition of some sort of hatred nor diminutive notions of women as lesser. It is to acknowledge the duty of a husband to his wife given by God. To ask women to perform outside of what is in their nature is an insult and demotion from how God has set them aside. The proper order of the natural world reflects the heavenly order as defined in 1 Corinthians 11:3,

    “But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.”

From here it can be seen that the definition of male headship within Christian teaching is the divine institution of husbands to be leaders, always protecting and loving their wives. Similarly the wife’s role is unified to this, which also must be upheld, stated as

    “Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.” —Ephesians 5:33

The problem is that men everywhere are internalizing and defining themselves in response to how women perceive them. If Catholic social and sexual morality is the norm, then the men must become men again and lead. This false masculinity has been shifted away from being about men, God, and moral law, instead it has been shifted to the idolization of the feminine over the masculine, rejecting the ordered cooperation of Creation’s design.

# A Call to Greatness

This comfort and pride of life is what St Paul warned us of,

    “The married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided” —1 Corinthians 7:33-34

Yet God raised marriage to the dignity of a sacrament. This tension demands vigilance, not indulgence. A man must not lose himself in comfort, but strive for greatness within marriage or celibacy alike. To reach out beyond self and into the transcendent—always aspiring and striving for greatness.

A man of the world no longer seeks to improve the world, instead he looks at what may be consumed. This man does not think of architecture, culture, or service. These deepest sentiments of the transcendentals must be imbibed within the soul and our society as the conduits of virtue. Striving to innovate, design, and build in accordance with God’s beauty is how the greatness of God is proclaimed upon the earth. This is why men built the cathedrals, not to proclaim themselves as gods, but to proclaim the majesty of God. The fruits of a corrupted vision will yield only another form of society that has been cut to its core losing all arterial flow from the Catholic foundations, which the historical virtue had sprung forth from. It is our job to lead our society upward towards God. The Christian’s life is not one of ease or pleasure, but a continual warfare, a continual labor, a continual self-denial, a continual sacrifice of himself to God.

# Meekness is to be Dangerous

The masculine identity is dangerous. A man’s identity must be forged in the fire of responsibility, discipline, and transcendence–never giving a moment to complacency. He must become dangerous, capable of wielding power, influence, knowledge, competency, and physical strength in the service of the good, the true, and the beautiful. He must become the renaissance man, a one man army. A man must count every second to fulfill his capacity and avoid complacency.

Men have to be competent and work hard to be dangerous in the virtuous sense. Being dangerous is the alternative to being weak. It is the alternative to passivity to evil, retreatism, and inaction, which the false virtue of having children as an end in itself causes. Christ taught,

“Blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth” —Matthew 5:5

Meekness is not to be weak, it is to have the capability of wielding a sword yet leaving it sheathed. If you’re not a formidable force then there is no morality in your self control, because you never had any option but submission. The capacity for danger and control is what brings about the virtue.

    “Meekness moderates anger according to right reason.” —Summa Theologiae II-II, Q. 157, Art. 1

If you are harmless, then you are weak, and if you are weak, then you are not going to be good–because it’s very difficult and takes strength to be good.
The Path Forward

We need men who cultivate skills to become excellent in their craft, their mission, and apply themselves always to change in the world. They must move beyond the trad LARP that treats marriage and children as an end in themselves, an approach that results in the premature end of the male life cycle. A living man is a man who seeks God in all things and dares to shape the world in the image of the Logos.

The Christian is not called to a life of ease, but to one of sacrifice, whether in the married state or in celibacy, for both are paths to holiness when lived for God.

In this context, marriage is no retreat. It is a shared mission. The mutual respect of the sexes for each other is only acquired in real life. The more a woman is truly female the more a man is disarmed of arrogance and comes to appreciate the woman. Similarly, the more a man is a real man and carries out his work and life task, the more the woman finds her natural place beside him. Male and female no longer separated, but as a united front together, as a Holy shared mission.

If you feel pressured to never again fight for what is right within the world, you are losing yourself and sight of true Christian love.

    “The family, which is founded and given life by love, is a community of persons: of husband and wife, of parents and children, of relatives... Its first task is to live with fidelity the reality of communion in a constant effort to develop an authentic community of persons.” — Familiaris Consortio, St. John Paul II, Paragraph 18 (1981)

# Conclusion: Become Undisputed

The man’s job is not to be liked, or even to have comfort, it is to be good. It is to become undisputed in his domain—not by domination, but by excellence, to be an agent in the world for Christ. Keeping the end in sight, not falsely attributing virtue to means as their own end. Not falling victim to domesticity, as so many do, once they enter a relationship with a woman. Strengthen the Church. Protect the weak. Being the kind of man who could build a cathedral—or perform similarly virtuous feats for the glory of God and salvation of souls, acting as an agent of God in the world—a true soldier of Christ. This is the man’s challenge, and the world needs him to rise.

    “Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Your Name give glory.” —Psalm 115:1
